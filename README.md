# 🎙️Automated Meeting Minutes Generator

This project is an automated meeting transcription and summarization tool designed to help teams capture discussions without the hassle of manual note-taking. It processes .mp3 meeting recordings and generates structured meeting minutes, including:

✅ Key discussion points

✅ Action items

✅ Decisions made

Built with Python, the tool leverages speech-to-text and NLP techniques to ensure accurate transcription and meaningful summarization. By automating documentation, it reduces manual effort and significantly improves meeting productivity.

## Documentation

### Project Overview
This project generates synthetic meeting datasets for testing natural language processing (NLP) and AI applications.  
The dataset includes meeting transcripts and extracted action items in JSON format.  
Optionally, a TXT version of the dataset can also be generated.

### File Descriptions
- **synthetic_meetings.py**  
  Creates a synthetic dataset of meeting transcripts and action items.  
  By default, saves the dataset as `synthetic_meetings.json`.  
  The script also contains an optional (commented-out) section to export the dataset as `synthetic_meetings.txt`.

- **generator.py**  
  Contains helper code (extendable) that can be used to generate or process synthetic datasets.

- **synthetic_meetings.json**  
  The JSON dataset generated by `synthetic_meetings.py`.  
  Includes transcripts and structured action items (task, person, deadline).

- **synthetic_meetings.txt**  
  (Optional) A plain-text version of the dataset, useful for human-readable inspection.
